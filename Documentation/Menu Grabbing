20120106: Newer URL handling
We now have the requirement to load more than 1 modules at a specific URL, so we handle URLs with up to 10 parts
Setup a new url_handler table:
    -> urlhid
    -> url
    -> module
    -> permission
    -> num_parts: How many parts this URL has
    -> p0: part 1 of the url
    -> p1
    -> p2
        .
        .
    -> p9

URL handler Storing:
    -> If a URL that ends with a %, set num_parts to 0 since this URL handler handles all URLs starting with that stream specified
    -> The URLs will be broken into parts, each part can be a % or a string and are stored in p1, p2, ...

Handler Loading:
    -> We compute the number of parts np of the URL currently loaded
        -> Load all URL's where num_parts=np and num_parts = 0
    -> For each part of the URL:
        -> Check if the selected URLs have that part at that place or if they have a % at that place

Example:
    => URL: config/modules
        -> SQL: SELECT ... WHERE (num_parts=2 or num_parts=0) AND (p0='config' OR p0='%') AND (p1='module' or p1='%')


20121106: URL handling
File explaining how we grab the menu handler from the database

When a menu handlers are set by a module, we give it a fit value(How specific is this URL)
Fit value is composed of:
    URL length: j/w/er/% - 4
    # Wildcards: j/w/er/% - 1
    fit = (URL length * 2) - #wildcards
Fit calculation considerations
    -> Longer the URL that fits, the better it is, thats why we multiply URL by 2
    -> The longest URL with least wildcards is the best fit, so we minus #wildcards

Based on the menu, we get the possible handlers:
eg: admin/content/12 can have handlers:
        admin/content/12
        admin/content/%
        admin/%/12
        admin/%/%
        admin/content
        admin/%
        admin
