What you CAN'T do:
    Include a <head> section with styles. Apple Mail.app supports it, but Gmail and Hotmail do not, so it's a no-no. Hotmail will support a style section in the body but Gmail still doesn't.
    Link to an external stylesheet. Not many email clients support this, best to just forget it.
    Background-image / Background-position. Gmail is also the culprit on this one.
    Clear your floats. Gmail again.
    Margin. Yep, seriously, Hotmail ignores margins. Basically any CSS positioning at all doesn't work.
    Font-anything. Chances are Eudora will ignore anything you try to declare with fonts.

Make sure you do:
    Use inline styles
    Add alt tag for all images

Can do if needed:
    Use tables
