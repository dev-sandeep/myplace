JSmart
======

A Framework that can be used as the core for a web application. The main aim is to design a simple framework which can be extended into a web application. We want to keep the framework simple and lightweight and place major focus on performance. 

The main aim is to try to keep JSmart like a core php system, with a set of classes already provided that can be used, and some standards to facilitate teams developing different components.

Since most components used in web applications today are available as packages on the web, they can easily be plugged into this framework rather than having framework specific modules.
